  <p class="dark"/><br>About Dadi & Gagnamagnið</br><br></br>Dadi Freyr and his group, Gagnamagnið, won the hearts of many music fans in 2020 with their Eurovision entry, the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFZNvj-HfBU"><em>Think About Things</em> </a>. <em>TAT</em> reached 10th on the Scottish Singles chart, and 3rd in Ireland. The song's snazzy dance moves were widely copied during lockdown, and <u>many felt Iceland was a shoe-in for winning Eurovision 2020 for the first time ever!</u></p>
<p class="light"/>Sadly Eurovision was cancelled in 2020. Dadi and his group Gagnamagnið were called upon to write a new song for Eurovision 2021. The next song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zTbVRPh5EI"> <em>Ten Years</em></a> was a solid song- but 2021's EV field was very strong. Sadly, Gagnamagnið was the only group in Eurovision 2021 to have a bandmember come down with CV-19. In a show of solidarity Dadi decided that either all members should participate together in the finals, or none. They sent a taped performance to the final instead of doing the song live. Iceland came in 4th overall.

Dadi's fame also increased because Will Farrell made a Netflix film called <em>The Legend of Fire Saga</em> in 2020, in which he played an <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/eurovision_song_contest_the_story_of_fire_saga">Icelandic Eurovision contestant</a>. Following the success of the film, Fans asked Dadi to cover many of the film's silly songs (including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jkV8SeNW_Nc"><em>Ja Ja Ding Dong</em>)</a>.</p>
<p class="light"/>
Ironically while a fictional "Icelandic" Will Farrell got to play on the Eurovision stage, Dadi has not! He may be the most successful EV contestant never to have played in front of an EV audience. Lucky for him that most of his music is quite good and his current tour is <a href="https://tour.dadifreyr.com/">sold out</a>.
